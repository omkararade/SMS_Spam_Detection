Introduction:
The project targets the task of classifying electronic messages, such as emails or SMS messages, into two categories: spam and not spam. This classification is crucial for email clients and messaging apps to filter out unwanted or irrelevant messages, improving the overall user experience and reducing exposure to potential phishing scams or malicious content.
The code utilizes the Streamlit library, a web framework for Python that simplifies the creation of interactive web applications. Streamlit provides a user interface (UI) for interacting with the code and displaying results.

Pipeline:

The code follows a machine learning pipeline, consisting of the following stages:

Data Preprocessing: The transform_text function performs data preprocessing on the input text, which involves:

a. Lowercasing: Converting all characters to lowercase.

b. Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.

c. Alphanumeric Filtering: Removing non-alphanumeric characters (e.g., punctuation symbols, special characters).

d. Stop Word Removal: Eliminating common words that don't add much meaning to the text (e.g., "the," "a," "an").

e. Punctuation Removal: Removing punctuation marks that don't provide semantic context.

f. Stemming: Applying a stemming algorithm (PorterStemmer) to reduce words to their root form, reducing the number of unique words and improving the model's generalization ability.

Model Loading: The code loads pre-trained models using Pickle, a Python serialization tool.

a. TF-IDF Vectorizer: This model converts the preprocessed text into a numerical representation suitable for machine learning algorithms.

b. Machine Learning Model: This model is trained to classify emails or SMS messages as either spam or not spam. The specific type of machine learning model is not specified in the code, but it could be a classification algorithm like Naive Bayes or Support Vector Machines (SVM).

User Input and Prediction:

a. User Input: Streamlit's text area allows users to enter the message they want to classify.

b. Prediction: When the user clicks the "Predict" button, the code preprocesses the input message, applies the TF-IDF vectorizer to convert it into a numerical representation, and feeds the transformed text to the trained machine learning model. The model's prediction (spam or not spam) is then displayed using Streamlit's header element.

Stages:

The pipeline can be summarized in the following stages:

Input: User enters the message to be classified.

Preprocessing: Text is cleaned, normalized, and transformed.

Feature Extraction: TF-IDF vectorizer converts text into numerical representation.

Prediction: Machine learning model classifies the message as spam or not spam.

Output: Prediction is displayed to the user.

This framework pipeline enables users to easily classify emails or SMS messages using a pre-trained machine learning model, providing a straightforward interface for spam filtering and message categorization.
